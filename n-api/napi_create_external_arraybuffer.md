* `[in] env`: The environment that the API is invoked under.
* `[in] external_data`: Pointer to the underlying byte buffer of the
  `ArrayBuffer`.
* `[in] byte_length`: The length in bytes of the underlying buffer.
* `[in] finalize_cb`: Optional callback to call when the `ArrayBuffer` is being
  collected. [`napi_finalize`][] provides more details.
* `[in] finalize_hint`: Optional hint to pass to the finalize callback during
  collection.
* `[out] result`: A `napi_value` representing a JavaScript `ArrayBuffer`.

Returns `napi_ok` if the API succeeded.

This API returns a Node-API value corresponding to a JavaScript `ArrayBuffer`.
The underlying byte buffer of the `ArrayBuffer` is externally allocated and
managed. The caller must ensure that the byte buffer remains valid until the
finalize callback is called.

The API adds a `napi_finalize` callback which will be called when the JavaScript
object just created is ready for garbage collection. It is similar to
`napi_wrap()` except that:

* the native data cannot be retrieved later using `napi_unwrap()`,
* nor can it be removed later using `napi_remove_wrap()`, and
* the object created by the API can be used with `napi_wrap()`.

JavaScript `ArrayBuffer`s are described in
[Section 24.1][] of the ECMAScript Language Specification.

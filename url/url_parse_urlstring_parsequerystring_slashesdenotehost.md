> Stability: 3 - Legacy: Use the WHATWG URL API instead.

* `urlString` {string} The URL string to parse.
* `parseQueryString` {boolean} If `true`, the `query` property will always
  be set to an object returned by the [`querystring`][] module's `parse()`
  method. If `false`, the `query` property on the returned URL object will be an
  unparsed, undecoded string. **Default:** `false`.
* `slashesDenoteHost` {boolean} If `true`, the first token after the literal
  string `//` and preceding the next `/` will be interpreted as the `host`.
  For instance, given `//foo/bar`, the result would be
  `{host: 'foo', pathname: '/bar'}` rather than `{pathname: '//foo/bar'}`.
  **Default:** `false`.

The `url.parse()` method takes a URL string, parses it, and returns a URL
object.

A `TypeError` is thrown if `urlString` is not a string.

A `URIError` is thrown if the `auth` property is present but cannot be decoded.

Use of the legacy `url.parse()` method is discouraged. Users should
use the WHATWG `URL` API. Because the `url.parse()` method uses a
lenient, non-standard algorithm for parsing URL strings, security
issues can be introduced. Specifically, issues with [host name spoofing][] and
incorrect handling of usernames and passwords have been identified.

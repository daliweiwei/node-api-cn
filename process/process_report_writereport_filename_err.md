* `filename` {string} Name of the file where the report is written. This
  should be a relative path, that will be appended to the directory specified in
  `process.report.directory`, or the current working directory of the Node.js
  process, if unspecified.
* `err` {Error} A custom error used for reporting the JavaScript stack.

* Returns: {string} Returns the filename of the generated report.

Writes a diagnostic report to a file. If `filename` is not provided, the default
filename includes the date, time, PID, and a sequence number. The report's
JavaScript stack trace is taken from `err`, if present.

```js
process.report.writeReport();
```
